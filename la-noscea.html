      <h2>La Noscea</h2>
      <p class="opener">At the east of Eorzea, on the sub-continent of Vylbrand, lies La Noscea. One of the great City States, Limsa Lominsa, acts as the capital and is home to the Maelstrom, La Noscea's Grand Company.
      <br><br>
      This lush, verdant island is full of wild, rocky landscapes as well as coasts and forests. You can while away the time staring the ocean, and maybe catch a few fish whilst you're at it.</p>
      
      <p>Upper La Noscea is split into two parts to the East and West, separated in the middle by Bronze Lake, which houses the ruins of the Wanderer's Palace. There is a ferry service that can take you from one side to the other.
      <br><br>
      This location is surrounded by lush crags and rock faces. Moving further north takes you into the mountainous region, where the Kobolds reside in O'Ghamoro.
      <br><br>
      Thanks to the hot springs at Camp Bronze Lake, this area is a popular not only as a tourist attraction but also for healing injuries with long, frequent soaks.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Similar to Upper La Noscea, East La Noscea is separated into two distinct zones, but this time it is due to a mountain range in the middle separating Wineport and the jungle to the Western side, and the beach of Costa del Sol to the Eastern side.
      <br><br>
      Though the jungles of East La Noscea are breath-taking, they are also dangerous with a number of dangerous wildlife such as coeurls and goobbues calling this area home. The river outside of Wineport connects this area to Costa del Sol via boat.
      <br><br>
      The beach resort of Costa del Sol was purchased by Uldahn merchant Gegeruju when Limsa Lominsa deemed this area unfit for agriculture. Since then this site has been host to the yearly festival, the Moonfire Faire.</p>
      <div class="second-div">
        <img src="assets/images/east_noscea_jungle.webp" alt="A dusk-time view of the East La Noscean jungle. The bioluminescent red plants provide natural lighting, but barely illuminate the giant toads and jungle coeurls prowling within." class="content-images">
        <img src="assets/images/east_noscea_costa.webp" alt="An ariel view of Costa del Sol. The many wooden walkways lead to huts suspended above crystal clear waters for a view of the glowing reefs and never-ending sea." class="content-images">
      </div>
      <p>Middle La Noscea is a pastoral landscape of rolling hills bordering Galadion Bay, formerly known as Bearded Rock. The creation of several rivers in the region following the Seventh Umbral Calamity made for a fertile landscape for Limsa Lominsa's pirates-turned-farmers. 
        <br><br>
        The Agelyss Wise river can be seen cutting through the landscape, of which two bridges were erected that lead to the Thre-Malm Bend via a Skylight - an elevator leading down a sheer cliff edge. <br><br>
        Whereas in the second image we have a sunset view of the main bulk of Limsa Lominsa seen from atop Summerford Farms. The Zephyr Drift strethcing across the left, named as such for the westerly breeze that graces the idyllic grasslands.</p>
