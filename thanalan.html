      <h2>Thanalan</h2>
      <p class="opener">To the South of Eorzea sits Thanalan. The Immortal Flames keep the peace as the Grand Company of Ul'dah, governed by the Sultana, Nanamo Ul Namo, and members of the Syndicate.
      <br><br>
        Many are wont to call Thanalan an arid desert, but it is closer to a savannah, with areas of varied wildlife near rivers and water sources. Do be careful to take a waterskin should you travel to the Sagolii Desert, however.
      </p>
      <p>East Thanalan connects the region to the South Shroud as well as Central and Western Thanalan. It is a sweeping Savannah with a settlement known as Camp Drybone, and the mining town of the Golden Bazaar.
      <br><br>
      The Highbridge connects the path from Camp Drybone over an immense chasm towards the Burning Wall, a cliff structure of gargantuan corrupted Crystal.
      <br><br>
      This crystal cliff used to be unscalable before the fall of Dalamud and the Seventh Umbral Calamity, which broke several sections and allowed for traversal and exploration for the first time.</p>

        <img src="assets/images/east_thanalan_plains.webp" alt="A foggy savannah stretches out with corrupted fire crystals permeating the background. The sky is grey and covered in clouds." class="content-images">
        <img src="assets/images/east_thanalan_crystals.webp" alt="A small lake with glowing corrupted fire crystals, their light penetrating the fog. Land bridges of crystal allow for travel through this area." class="content-images">
      </div>
      <p>Southern Thanalan is the most desertified of the region, containing much less vegetation then the other areas, as well as the Sagolii Desert.
      <br><br>
      There are two areas that contain oases and settlements - Little Ala Mhigo and the Forgotten Springs. Little Ala Mhigo is a camp of Ala Mhigan refugees that fled to Eorzea during the Garlean occupation of their region.
      <br><br>
      The Forgotten Springs is a settlement of Mi'qote of the U Tribe, or the "Children of the Sand". Be very careful if you wish to visit however, as you may run into a strange horde of fashionably dressed, and oddly posturing, undead.</p>
      <div class="second-div">
        <img src="assets/images/south_thanalan_desert.webp" alt="A large, yellow desert covers the land with large barren rock faces in the distance. An oil rig of sorts can be seen in the centre." class="content-images">
        <img src="assets/images/south_thanalan_spring.webp" alt="An oasis settlement at the side of the desert with trees and plantlife, as well as a central aetheryte." class="content-images">
      </div>
      <p>Directly outside the gates of Nald and Thal of Ul'dah, you will find Central Thanalan. This area connects to each other cardinal direction of Thanalan.
      <br><br>
      Though desolate, there are several oases, as well as camps and building found in Central Thanalan, including a transport railway system for mining that runs through Black Brush, The Clutch where miners can get a drink, and those of the impoverished and the displaced.
      <br><br>
      This area portrays the dichotomy of the those with and those without in the City of Ul'dah. There are also very big ants. Watch out for those.</p>
      <div class="third-div">
        <img src="assets/images/central_thanalan_base.webp" alt="A camp with railroads intersecting can be seen in the middle of this rocky plain. A structure has been built into the side of a rockface." class="content-images">
        <img src="assets/images/central_thanalan_uldah.webp" alt="A nighttime view of Ul'dah can be seen from above the plains. A campsite and rail station can be seen to the left." class="content-images">
