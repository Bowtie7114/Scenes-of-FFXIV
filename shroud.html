      <h2>The Black Shroud</h2>
      <p class="opener">At the center of Eorzea, is the Black Shroud. The great City State of Gridania at it's heart, it and the elementals are protected and kept in balance by the Woodwailers and the Order of the Twin Adder, the Shroud's Grand Company.
      <br><br>
      Though it still bares scars from the Seventh Umbral Calamity, the Shroud is brimming with nature - both plant life and animal life of all kinds floruish here. Take a walk and listen to the sounds of the wild, and you will feel at peace before long.</p>
      <p>Within the South Shroud you can find Camp Tranquil and Quarrymill, both used as bases by the Wood Wailers to capture poachers and act as rest stops for travellers.
      <br><br>
      You can visit the abandoned Amdapor Keep, have a drink at Buscaroon's Druthers, or even take a look at the infamous Palace of the Dead.  
      <br><br>
      Urth's Fount is the home of the mysterious Odin, and it is said that through the centre crystal you can reach his domain. Perhaps you will capture a glimpse of Odin yourself?</p>

      </div>
      <p>East Shroud is home to some of the oldest trees in the Shroud, and the forest and undergrowth in this area is thick but majestic.
      <br><br>
      The gorgeous Sanctum of the Twelve is not only for decoration, but where you can join in the Ceremony of Eternal Bonding, either as a guest or as one of the lucky two to be joined in witness of the Twelve.
      <br><br>
      The Sylphs of Little Solace will gladly show those who are friendly to the forest around, and share in useful knowledge, but be careful should you venture into the murky Sylphlands as tempered Sylphs are like to attack first and talk never.</p>
      <div class="second-div">
        <img src="assets/images/east_shroud_church.webp" alt="The Church of the Twelve in the East Shroud, the large glass windows shining a pale orange atop a large shallow pond. The monument of the Twelve is in clear view, with each of their respective symbols." class="content-images">
        <img src="assets/images/east_shroud_sylph.webp" alt="A dark purple hue blankets the Sylphlands forest. Thick tall trees coat the area, with purple lights and structures hanging from the branches." class="content-images">
      </div>
      <p>The North Shroud is, as one may surmise, also greatly forested, however it is also on the border to the now frozen lands of Coerthas, where the site of the Seventh Umbral Calamity is located.
      <br><br>
      Fallgourd Float is an idyllic stop on the way towards Coerthas, being found on a lake with several platforms and walkways formed from large fallen trees.
      <br><br>
      Stepping outside Fallgourd Float, you will see that devastation that the last war had on the land yet to recover, but also the impressive Allagan Technology of a fragment of Dalamud in the distance, large enough and strong enough to contain the Elder Primal, Bahamut.</p>
