## Testing ##

### Bugs ###
When styling the Store Page icons from Font Awesome (Steam and Meteor), using the 'i' attribute did not allow the colour to change as it did with the Socials icons. I had to use the 'a' attribute. This will not be looked into as it works and is a minor cosmetic issue.
<br>
When creating wireframes, copying the mobile homepage facebook image changed it to a different facebook image on paste. Did not change as it does not affect functionality.
