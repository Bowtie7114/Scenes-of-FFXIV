## Testing ##

### Bugs ###
When styling the Store Page icons from Font Awesome (Steam and Meteor), using the 'i' attribute did not allow the colour to change as it did with the Socials icons. I had to use the 'a' attribute. This will not be looked into as it works as is.
<br>
When creating wireframes, copying the mobile homepage facebook image changed it to a different facebook image on paste. Did not change as it does not affect functionality.
<br>
When attempting to add a second font to the site via import from Google Fonts, the formatting broke, causing either the original font I had download and added via @font-face to break and revert to serif, or for the header style to break. This was corrected by instead downloading the font pack, uploading to the repo and applying via @font-face.
<br>
I was unable to utilise the Instagram page for FFXIV without being signed into Instagram. Testing this with my girlfriend's instagram allowed the link to work without issue (https://www.instagram.com/ffxiv?igsh=dmJrcmNoNDM4cmJ0) as such, the Instagram homepage will be used to avoid a 404 error for those that do not have Instagram accounts.
<br>
Upon testing with other people (Discord server full of friends) the Chrome users identified an issue with the images not showing next to each other as intended, and as Firefox did. Upon some testing, a float attribute was needed for the images on Chrome and Edge to stop them from wrapping around each other. Image was rectified and re-tested with those same users and the images were showing as intended.

### Feedback ###
When testing mobile, feedback received was that the nav menu opened on the left where the burger icon was on the right. As such, this was changed for a better UX. Upon re-testing, several user reported this feature was much improved.
