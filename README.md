# Scenes of FFXIV #
Scenes of FFXIV is a site intended to showcase a number of locations from the critically acclaimed MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV (FFXIV).
It will contain a number of in-game screenshots from these locations as well as some descriptive text detailing the history or some key features of the landscape shown.

This site is intended for any who may be interested in FFXIV, whether it is existing players, those who cannot play, who used to and wish for a feeling of nostalgia, or those who are on the fence and may want a closer look at some of the vistas that are on offer.

## Testing ##

### Bugs ###
When styling the Store Page icons from Font Awesome (Steam and Meteor), using the 'i' attribute did not allow the colour to change as it did with the Socials icons. I had to use the 'a' attribute. This will not be looked into as it works and is a minor cosmetic issue.
<br>
When creating wireframes, copying the mobile homepage facebook image changed it to a different facebook image on paste. Did not change as it does not affect functionality.

### Content ###
- Font family downloaded from [FontMeme](https://fontmeme.com/fonts/enge-etienne-font/), created by OPTIFONT.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) for information on various HTML and CSS tips.
- [Final Fantasy XIV Fan Kit site](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/special/fankit/icon/) for various icons used as favicons and README title accompaniment.
- [Final Fantasy XIV Materials Usage License](https://support.na.square-enix.com/rule.php?id=5382&tag=authc) confirming the feasibility of the project and what concessions are required.

### Media ###
- Content images were taken by myself using my own FFXIV account and the in-game screenshot function. Due to weather conditions and a day night cycle, this proved somewhat taxing.
- The Coming Soon image is the public base game render of a Lalafellan Alchemist. The image itself was taken from the [Final Fantasy Wiki](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Alchemist_(Final_Fantasy_XIV)).
