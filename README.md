This site is intended for any who may be interested in FFXIV, whether it is existing players, those who cannot play, who used to and wish for a feeling of nostalgia, or those who are on the fence and may want a closer look at some of the vistas that are on offer.

### Bugs ###
When styling the Store Page icons from Font Awesome (Steam and Meteor), using the 'i' attribute did not allow the colour to change as it did with the Socials icons. I had to use the 'a' attribute. This will not be looked into as it works and is a minor cosmetic issue.
